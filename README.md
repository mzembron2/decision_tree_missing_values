# Implemmntation of decison tree classifier with probablistic missing values handling

## Introduction
This project provides the implementation of a decision tree classifier with missing values handling, as described in [Pawel Cichosz's book](http://elektron.elka.pw.edu.pl/~pcichosz/SU/) (also shortly [here](docs/UMA_brakujace_wartosci.pdf)).

## Requirements

To run the code, Python 3.x is required, with the following packages:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn

## Using classifer

To use implemented classifier include this project into your system and import DecisionTreeWithMissingValuesClassifier from dt_missing_values. 
An example of usage is shown in the file: [`main.py`](scripts/main.py).
